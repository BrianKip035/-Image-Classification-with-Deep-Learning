# -Image-Classification-with-Deep-Learning

## Business Understanding

Image classification with deep learning can be used to identify pneumonia cases in medical imaging such as chest X-rays. This can be useful in assisting healthcare professionals to make accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.
Stakeholders in this application of deep learning could include:
Healthcare professionals: Doctors and radiologists can use the deep learning model to assist them in identifying pneumonia cases in medical imaging.
Patients: Patients can benefit from accurate and timely diagnoses and treatments resulting from the use of deep learning in medical imaging.
Hospitals and medical centers: Hospitals and medical centers can use the deep learning model as a tool to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia cases, which can lead to better patient outcomes and more efficient use of medical resources.
Medical device manufacturers: Companies that manufacture medical imaging devices can incorporate deep learning models into their products to provide more accurate and efficient diagnosis of pneumonia cases.
Insurance companies: Insurance companies can benefit from more accurate diagnoses and treatments resulting from the use of deep learning in medical imaging, which can lead to cost savings and improved health outcomes for their customers
