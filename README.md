## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years, AI has been used in a variety of industries. Such as data mining, manufacturing, and financial services. By building the right models, humans can use AI to perform many tasks that once required complex human intervention. One of the most notable applications is the use of AI in healthcare.

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can affect people of all ages, but it is especially dangerous for the elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems. The traditional method for diagnosing pneumonia is through a physical examination and laboratory tests, but these methods are time-consuming and frequently require multiple visits to the doctor. This project aims to solve this real-world problem by developing a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has pneumonia based on a chest x-ray image.

This project is important for healthcare professionals and patients who need to get the right diagnosis quickly. Doctors like radiologists and ophthalmologists can use the deep learning model to help them diagnose different medical conditions using medical images. Accurate diagnoses help patients get the right treatment and have better health.
## Limitation
Based on the training results, the VGG16 model achieved an accuracy of approximately 74% on the validation set.
The recall score for the pneumonia class was consistently at 100%, which indicates that the model was able to correctly identify all instances of pneumonia in the validation set.
the loss values for the model were decreasing across epochs, which indicates that the model was learning and improving over time.
