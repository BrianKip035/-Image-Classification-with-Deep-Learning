![pneumonia_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116070221/225555011-e5e82fe6-013d-435c-a25c-d8b9b619de05.jpg)

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
> With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years, AI has been used in a variety of industries. Such as data mining, manufacturing, and financial services. By building the right models, humans can use AI to perform many tasks that once required complex human intervention. One of the most notable applications is the use of AI in healthcare.
> Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can affect people of all ages, but it is especially dangerous for the elderly, young children, and those with weakened immune systems. The traditional method for diagnosing pneumonia is through a physical examination and laboratory tests, but these methods are time-consuming and frequently require multiple visits to the doctor. This project aims to solve this real-world problem by developing a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has pneumonia based on a chest x-ray image.
> This project is important for healthcare professionals and patients who need to get the right diagnosis quickly. Doctors like radiologists and ophthalmologists can use the deep learning model to help them diagnose different medical conditions using medical images. Accurate diagnoses help patients get the right treatment and have better health.
> Researchers, academics, and government agencies are other stakeholders that may be interested in the development of deep learning models for medical imaging. Researchers can use the models to learn more about diseases and develop new treatments. Government agencies can regulate the use of deep learning in healthcare to make sure it is safe and effective.

## TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
> 1. Build a deep learning model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia based on a chest x-ray image.
> 2. Optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the validation set.
> 3. Use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
> 4. Experiment with different optimization algorithms, learning rates, and batch sizes to improve the speed and stability of model training.
> 5. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## BUSINESS OBJECTIVES
> 1. Provide pediatricians with a tool that can quickly and accurately diagnose pneumonia in children, potentially reducing the number of unnecessary hospital visits and improving patient outcomes.
> 2. Increase the accessibility of pneumonia diagnosis in low-resource settings where trained medical professionals may not be readily available.
> 3. Potentially reduce healthcare costs by allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients.
> 4. Contribute to the development of a larger dataset for pneumonia diagnosis that can be used for further research and model development.
> 5. Develop a model that can be easily integrated into existing hospital or clinic workflows, allowing for streamlined and efficient diagnosis.

## SUCCESS METRICS
The model will be a successs if the following metric scores are above above 90%.
> 1. Precision: The precision metric measures how well the model is able to correctly identify pneumonia cases out of all the samples it predicts as positive.

> 2. Recall: The recall metric measures how well the model is able to correctly identify pneumonia cases out of all the actual pneumonia cases in the dataset.

> 3. F1 Score: The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a combined measure of the model's accuracy and sensitivity. 

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
 The data source for this project is Kermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), “Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images”, Mendeley Data, V3.The dataset contains 5,847 Chest X-Ray images from patients, with 1,574 images labeled as normal and 4,273 images labeled as pneumonia.The data can be found here

Descriptive statistics for the features used in the analysis are not applicable in this case since the images are not numerical data. Instead, image pre-processing techniques are applied to transform the images into numerical data that can be used to train a deep learning model.


###  DATASET LIMITATION
- Due to the fact that the images were obtained from a particular hospital and may not be applicable to other populations, one limitation of the dataset is that it might not be representative of all Chest X-Ray images.
- There are fewer pneumonia cases than normal cases, the dataset may be skewed. This could impair the model's ability to accurately classify pneumonia cases.
- The dataset does not include any information about the patients' demographics or medical histories, which could be useful in predicting pneumonia.

## MODELING.
The modeling process can be broken down into four main steps:

1. Model Selection: The first step in the modeling process is to choose a suitable model architecture that can perform the task of classifying chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal. In this case, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is commonly used for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial features in images.

2. Model Training: Once a suitable model architecture has been selected, the next step is to train the model on the training dataset using backpropagation to optimize the model's parameters. During training, the model is presented with a series of chest X-ray images labeled as either pneumonia or normal, and the model learns to distinguish between the two classes by adjusting its internal weights. As the model is trained, its performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the training process can be adjusted accordingly to improve the model's accuracy.

3. Model Evaluation: Once the model has been trained, it is evaluated on the testing set to assess its performance on new, unseen data. This evaluation gives an estimate of the model's accuracy and helps to determine whether the model is ready for deployment in a production environment.

4. Model Deployment: If the model's performance is satisfactory, it can be deployed in a production environment to classify new chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal. In a production environment, the model will typically receive input images, process them through the trained CNN, and output a prediction of whether the input image contains pneumonia or not.

Overall, the modeling process is an iterative one, with the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics adjusted as needed to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. The final goal is to create a model that can accurately and reliably classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal, which can help in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with respiratory diseases.

## CONCLUSIONS
- Based on the training results, the VGG16 model achieved an accuracy of approximately 74% on the validation set.

- The recall score for the pneumonia class was consistently at 100%, which indicates that the model was able to correctly identify all instances of pneumonia in the validation set.

- The loss values for the model were decreasing across epochs, which indicates that the model was learning and improving over time.
