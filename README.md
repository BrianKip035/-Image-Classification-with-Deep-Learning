## TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
> 1. Build a deep learning model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia based on a chest x-ray image.
> 2. Optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the validation set.
> 3. Use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
> 4. Experiment with different optimization algorithms, learning rates, and batch sizes to improve the speed and stability of model training.
> 5. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
