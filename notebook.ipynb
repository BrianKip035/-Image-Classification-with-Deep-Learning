    "The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model for medical image classification using a large dataset of labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray images. The project addresses a real-world problem faced by medical professionals, which is the accurate and timely diagnosis of diseases based on medical images. Accurately interpreting medical images is time-consuming and requires specialized training. The specific problem this project aims to solve is the accurate diagnosis of medical conditions using OCT and Chest X-Ray images, which provide vital information that can support clinical decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders for this project are healthcare professionals and patients who require accurate and timely diagnoses to facilitate proper treatment. Healthcare professionals, such as radiologists, ophthalmologists, and other specialists, could use the deep learning model developed through this project to assist in the diagnosis of various medical conditions based on medical images. Patients would benefit from accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatments, leading to improved health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders in this application of deep learning include healthcare professionals, patients, hospitals and medical centers, medical device manufacturers, and insurance companies. Healthcare professionals can use the deep learning model to assist them in identifying pneumonia cases in medical imaging, leading to more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. Patients can benefit from accurate and timely diagnoses and treatments resulting from the use of deep learning in medical imaging. Hospitals and medical centers can use the deep learning model as a tool to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions, leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient use of medical resources. Medical device manufacturers can incorporate deep learning models into their products to provide more accurate and efficient diagnosis of medical conditions. Insurance companies can benefit from more accurate diagnoses and treatments resulting from the use of deep learning in medical imaging, leading to cost savings and improved health outcomes for their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's value lies in its potential to improve medical diagnosis accuracy and treatment outcomes. By accurately classifying medical images, medical professionals can make more informed decisions regarding patient care. Additionally, this project has the potential to enhance the efficiency of medical diagnosis and reduce the need for invasive procedures, such as biopsies. Image classification with deep learning can also be used to identify pneumonia cases in medical imaging such as chest X-rays, which can be useful in assisting healthcare professionals to make accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project aims to develop a deep learning model for medical image classification to assist in the accurate and timely diagnosis of medical conditions using OCT and Chest X-Ray images. The project's stakeholders include healthcare professionals, patients, hospitals and medical centers, medical device manufacturers, and insurance companies. The project's value lies in its potential to improve medical diagnosis accuracy, treatment outcomes, and the efficiency of medical diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs."

    "1. Build a deep learning model that can classify whether a given patient has pneumonia based on a chest x-ray image.\n",
    "2. Optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the validation set.\n",
    "3. Use data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.\n",
    "3. Experiment with different optimization algorithms, learning rates, and batch sizes to improve the speed and stability of model training.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "1. Provide pediatricians with a tool that can quickly and accurately diagnose pneumonia in children, potentially reducing the number of unnecessary hospital visits and improving patient outcomes.\n",
    "2. Increase the accessibility of pneumonia diagnosis in low-resource settings where trained medical professionals may not be readily available.\n",
    "3. Potentially reduce healthcare costs by allowing for earlier diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in pediatric patients.\n",
    "4. Contribute to the development of a larger dataset for pneumonia diagnosis that can be used for further research and model development.\n",

    "The data source for this project is  Kermany, Daniel; Zhang, Kang; Goldbaum, Michael (2018), “Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images”, Mendeley Data, V3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 5,856 Chest X-Ray images from 2,839 patients, with 3,955 images labeled as \"normal\" and 1,901 images labeled as \"pneumonia\".[Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is suitable for the project because it contains labeled medical images that can be used to train a deep learning model to accurately classify medical conditions. Medical imaging is an important tool for diagnosing and treating diseases, and accurate and timely diagnoses are critical for improving patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics for the features used in the analysis are not applicable in this case since the images are not numerical data. Instead, image pre-processing techniques are applied to transform the images into numerical data that can be used to train a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of features in this project is based on the relevance of the medical images in accurately diagnosing medical conditions. The dataset contains images of normal conditions as well as those with CNV, DME, and DRUSEN, which are conditions that affect the retina of the eye. By including these conditions in the dataset, the deep learning model can be trained to accurately identify and classify these conditions based on medical images.\n",

    "##  Dataset Limitation\n",
    "One limitation of the dataset is that it may not be representative of all Chest X-Ray images, as the images were obtained from a specific hospital and may not be generalizable to other populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the dataset may be imbalanced since there are fewer pneumonia cases compared to normal cases. This could affect the model's ability to accurately classify pneumonia cases. Another limitation is that the dataset does not provide any information about the patients' demographics or medical histories, which may be relevant for predicting pneumonia."
